      description: By default, a sitemap will be generated if one does not exist (checked every time a page is saved from the admin panel). If you disable this feature you will have to add the site map page manually in order to include it. Be aware that WCAG 2.4.5 - Multiple Ways requires multiple ways to navigate through a site's pages. If you disable the automatic sitemap generation, do not add one manually, and do not implement some other site navigation method, you may be in violation of this requirement.
